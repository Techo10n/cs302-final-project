Working Title (Subject to Change): LemOn

Name: [redacted]

Purpose: Convenient application to sort and search music

Description: The database stores data on songs that are written by artists and can be sorted by users and artists into playlists and albums. Users will also be able to like and leave comments on songs. Comments contain a body of text and can be liked, disliked, and replied to. Each song will have a name and include information about its duration, genre, likes and dislikes, which album it belongs to (if any), and which artist (or artists) wrote the song. Each user has a username, email, and password. Other information about users is also stored, including their country and birthdate. All artists must be users, but not all users are artists. Artists will have an artist name and a founding date, and the database also keeps track of each artist's total likes and views. Playlists can only be created by users, and have a name, an optional description, and also store information about the number of songs in the playlist, the total duration of the playlist, and the date of playlist creation. Albums must be created by artists and contain the same information as playlists (minus the description), along with the albumâ€™s genre.

Potential Users: Anyone who enjoys listening to music, likely a younger audience.

Sample User Questions: What songs are on this playlist? Which artist wrote this song? Which songs did this artist write? What genre does this song belong to? What genre(s) does this artist typically write? How many minutes long is this song? How many views does this song have? How many views does this artist have? [What are the comments on this song?]
Project Requirements: Implementing the one-to-many and many-to-many relationships between users and playlists, playlists and songs, and other relationships will require some thought and may require intermediate tables. For example, if a song has multiple artists, a junction table may be required to implement the plural artist foreign key for the song. I believe this finished project will exceed expectations, and as I work on it, there will be opportunities to create an even more complex product.
